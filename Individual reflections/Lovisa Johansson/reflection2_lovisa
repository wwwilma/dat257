Last week I said that I wanted to learn the language and framework we use better as well as add more functionality to the project.
I feel like I have done both these things. There is a lot more to learn of course when it comes to javascript and react and the coming weeks I want to learn even more.
I did the menu on the page and I'm very happy with how it turned out and I felt that I learned new things. So next week I will continue to do my best and try to contribute to the project in a positive way.
The following weeks I also hope that I can come up with ideas to make our website even better.

This week I had some more difficulties compared to other weeks. I did a bigger card including some database things which was new for me in this project. 
It was more difficult than I had anticipted because it took a bit of time to understand all the things done before. We also encountered a problem with compatibility that was very hard to solve and we didn't manage to do it in time.
I say we because this week I did pair-programming which worked well. Even though there was a problem we worked well together to try to solve it.
Next week, I will hopefully solve the problem so the statistics work which would make the application even better. Hopefully this will also make me understand the database even better.

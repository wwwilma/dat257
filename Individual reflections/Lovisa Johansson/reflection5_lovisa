This week went better than the last. We solved the statistic pages connection to the database and it now works well with colors to indicate how much you have done each day.
I did some pair programming first with only Emma and then Isak joined as well. We cooperated well and we solved the problems from last week together. 
After this user story I feel a little more confident with the database and it has been fun to work on something new.
After this week the product looks very good and it has been fun to see the difference compared to the beginning weeks. It is really awarding to see the progress. 
Next week is the last week and also a shorter sprint. I hope to help the team reach the finished product next week and contribute to reach the goals we want.

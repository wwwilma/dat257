This week I learnt some basic React functionality to develop a button. This was a great introduction into the JavaScript language.
The start of the project was slow and alot of our userstories was dependet on oneanother which made it diffiicult to progress the project, this
is something that we can takeaway.
Next week my goal is to understand how to seperate the site into diffrent sections so more elements can be added.

My goal this week was to develop the design of the website, but I instead took on the challange to develop a database for the project. To do this i had to research
what type of database that were to be used. I decided on CrateDB with postgreSQL. I also had to get an understanding on how this could be used for the product so I
developed my own side project to test its functionality and what other compontents need to be created to get it to work.

What I learnt this week is nothing is as simple as it seems, something that you tink might be an easy task get more difficult
when made to work with something already exsitning project.

Next week I wish to implement the created database and teach the rest of the group how the database works and how they also can implement it.

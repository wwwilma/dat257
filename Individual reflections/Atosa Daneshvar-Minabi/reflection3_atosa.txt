This week has gone well! The group haven't run into any difficult problems as of yet besides a few merge conflicts. 
I contributed to making the statistics page this week by implementing calendars that shows how many times the buttons 
have been pushed each day with the help of a heatmap. It was very fun and I learnt a lot of new things as I hadn't done anything 
similar before, but the colors of the calendars could be improved. The difference in the app is quite big compared to what we
started with and it is progressing really well so I'm looking forward to next week, especially when we get to integrate the 
database with the calendars as I've hardcoded the data as of now.

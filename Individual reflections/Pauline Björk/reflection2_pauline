I feel like this week has been working well for both me and the other team members. This week is different from sprint 1 because I had my own user story card from our
scrumboard to work with. My responsibility was to create a logo and implement it into out header, based on the one in our mockup. This turned out great and I didn't
encounter any problems. 

This week I have had the honour of being the teams scrum master. I was a bit nervous how it would go, but it went really well and I am very satisfied with my work
considering how well our teamwork and results turned out. 

I plan to work as well next week as I did this week.

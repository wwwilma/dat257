This week I have been working as a helper for those team members who needed any support in their work, due to be not being avaliable during the majority of the week.
This was a one time occuring thing that hopefully won't happen again. I look forward to next week so that I can contribute more to the project and the team. The user
stories are starting to produce more complex webfunctions to develop, so it is going to be fun to see what I will be challanged with next week.

The first three weeks of this course has been going well with both lectures, exercises and team meetings. As our team consists of only IT students, we have a common 
ground on how working in groups has worked in our previous courses, which I think can be an advantage for us later on in the course. The assignments we have done so 
far has been carried out smoothly and all group members has participated.  Creating our social contract was not a hard task as it is something usually performed in 
all project courses we have completed. To come up with our project scope was a bit harder as we had a few ideas and all group members had different thoughts of 
functionalities. In the end, we all came together and everyone agreed on our scopes final draft.

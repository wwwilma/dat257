This week I wanted a bit more to do compared to the two previous weeks, which I got. My user story to make that card turn was really fun, but I encountered a few
problems as well. I main problems ws that the card didn't turn centered around its y-axis. This was solved but later recorrutred when mergin the others branches into
mine. But this was also fixed pretty fast. This week I felt acomplished and usefull to my group after fining my work. I hope to keep my good work and good communication
going into next week and can hopefully be even more helpful to the group. 

I hope to learn more about scum the next comming weeks, becayse right now it feels like we have quite a good product and I can imagine that i will be harder and harder
each week to know how to develope it a step further.

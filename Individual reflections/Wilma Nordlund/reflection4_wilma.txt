Individual Reflection 4

This week was a bit shorter due to 1st May. We still planned an ambitious sprint with quite a lot of story points.
Two of the user stories were given 13 story points, and both included pair programming.
I worked together with Kristin and Hanna to make the connection to the database.
We struggled a bit and didn't manage to resolve all acceptance criteria during the sprint.
The other user story with 13 points wasn't completed either.
I think it was a good learning experience; the week being a bit shorter wasn't the main problem.
Rather, the problem was with the user stories being too heavy and us not realising how long time it would take.
Next week, we will complete these stories.
It was a good experience to do some pair programming, an effective way of both working and learning.

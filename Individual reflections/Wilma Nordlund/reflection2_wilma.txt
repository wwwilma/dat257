Individual Reflection 2

This week we have worked with a bigger number of user stories in the sprint.
This means everyone had something more specific to do, and we got a lot of work done.
I had responsibility over the implementation of the card class, so that there can be multiple cards on the site.
Kristin was already working with the cards in her user story, so our work was related.
We worked together with the last documentation of the code, and then handled a few merging conflicts in the repository.
I like this way of working, and it's something that I've missed in previous group projects.
It's good to break the end goal down into a lot of smaller parts, so the work doesn't feel overwhelming.
It is a interesting way of working and I look forward to the coming weeks.

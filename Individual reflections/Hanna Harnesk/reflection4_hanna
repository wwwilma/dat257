(When writing reflection5 I realised I had forgot to post last weeks reflection. So here it it, apologies.)

During this sprint I have been working with Wilma and Kristin on connection to the database in order to save each users progress with their habits. 
The sprint was shorter than usual, and even though we teamed up on the card , we realised that we would have needed some more time in order to finish.
The pairprogramming  worked well on our wednesday-meeting where we met on campus, 
but in hindsight we would  have been better off arranging yet another meet-up in order so get all the acceptance-criteras finished.
I feel like we this would have made us more efficient, and it would have been easier to distribute the workload. 
For the next sprint I am interested in contributing more hands-on with the code.

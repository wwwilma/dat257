During this second sprint I worked with making a card for the tasks, with a picture, title and a button. I also worked with making a grid of cards.
I think that working in a agile way with the team has worked out well. Next week we need to have maybe one or two extra cards, so that if someone 
has time over, they can have someting to do.

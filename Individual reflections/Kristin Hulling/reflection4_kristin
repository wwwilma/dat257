This sprint, which was one day shorter, the team decided to do fewer but larger user stories, leading us to engage in more pair programming.
Hanna, Wilma, and I took on a relatively large user story in an area where we had limited knowledge. We only had 3 hours of pair programming, which 
resulted in not meeting all the acceptance criteria. I worked on the unfinished parts and completed them, but with a misunderstanding. I corrected 
the mistake at the end of Friday's meeting, but it was a little too late.

I also served as the scrum master this week, and it has been a fun experience to try a new role.

Next sprint, I want to learn more about how to make pair programming more effective.

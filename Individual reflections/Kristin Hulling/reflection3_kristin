This week I have learned more about how to use our database. Me and Isak was doing the same user story, so we did some pair-programming, which was a good 
experience where we exchanged our knowledge. I also helped Pauline out with a css problem that she was stuck on. Next week I will continue try to help other if I 
have time. I think that the team has planned the user story points for this week very well, the workload have been on a good level.

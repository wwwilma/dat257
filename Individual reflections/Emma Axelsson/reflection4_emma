Last week I said in my reflection that I wanted to do some functionality so this week I took a task together with Lovisa where the statistics should 
be updated in the heatmap calendar. It was challenging to get to know the code with the database, since the tasks I have done did not include this. 
Lovisa and I did pair programming which went great but we are having some trouble converting our data to the right format for the calendar. So we did not
manage to finish our task this week unfortunately.

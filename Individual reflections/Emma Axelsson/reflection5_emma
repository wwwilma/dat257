Last week Lovisa and I did not manage to finish our user story where the heatmap should be connected to the statistics from the 
database. This week we continued the work with that. In the end of last week we had some trouble with converting the data to the 
right format. After some time we solved that problem but got some small other errors, so after some time and debugging the heatmap
works fine! I'm satisfied with the work and that the user story ended up completely done since nexr week is the last sprint. 
Looking forward to complete the work with the application with the final touches!

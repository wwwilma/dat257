What I want to learn more about is javascript and react which we have decided to use for the project. This is all new to me and I haven't used it before.
I'm excited to learn and be able to contribute in the best way possible. 
This week we have not done very much technical things considering the short amount of time so next week I really want to contribute more on that part.
I have mostly read and tried learning the basics of react.
Next week, I want to create functionality on our website, which will of course help our project forward.
Generally, I'm happy with the sprint and it felt like a good start and i'm starting to feel more comfortable and we also have a fun project which makes it even better!

I think this week went well. I created a new page for all the habits which will eventually be filled with many new cards. It will also have a favourite section but thats a task for the future.
I did my best as I said last week that I would do. However, there is of course more to learn about the languages/framework we use and I feel that I learn more each week and I am excited to learn even more. 
I also said I wanted to come up with new ideas for the webpage which I did not do very much but that is because we have had some things we know we wanted to do in the beginning to get the basic functions.
I also was a part of some pair programming with Emma where I gave some input on colors for the webpage because it might be good with more than one opinion. It worked really well and was a nice way to approach the task.
Next week I want to continue working and contributing to the project. It is really fun to see all the changes that are made between the weeks.

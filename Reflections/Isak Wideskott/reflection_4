Last week I said I wanted to expand the backend and get more implementations done, but I decided to challange myself and change direction and 
work with other parts of the project.

So this week I tried doing some conditions in the javascript code to make the cards design be more fulent, with some visual updates and animation on action. I learnt
alot this week.

Next week i will challange myself agian by trying something new agian!

This week I solved the last problems with the user story that was left from last sprint. I have also worked on a user story, about favor habits, together with
Isak and Atosa, which worked out well. I think my pair programming skills has developed, since I have been working a lot with that. I am looking forward to the last sprint
and to make the final touches.

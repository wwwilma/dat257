At first it was some trouble getting the project started with a lot of different settings, but after some time I managed to get it right. This week I did a lot of research to learn more about javascript, html, css and react overall. I did some very small projects on my own to get to know the environment and learn how the basic works. I also read some documentation to learn more syntax and basic react. This week there were some difficulties with the scrum consider the short amount of time but I think the group have a good idea about how scrum works which will make it easier for us to get started in next week.

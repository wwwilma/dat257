Lat week was a lot about researching and collecting knowledge about how react works. I really felt that I entered this sprint with some basic knowledge
that helped me to get started on my user story. My user story for this sprint was to create some more structure on the website, and the acceptance criteria
was that it should be a header and a footer which went great. Altought this was a very simple solution and I think that we should develop it into a 
component in the future. It was very fun to really get started with the project! Looking forward to next week with the group!

This week I had two smaller user stories, one that said the button should visually be pressed down and one that said there should be a color theme on
the website. Both user stories went quite well, altough I had some smaller problems that made the design not exacly how I thoght it would end up like. 
The button is only working when I press down my mouse, but not using touch on the touchpad, altough this works on other computers in the group so it
will work for now. The footer follows the bottom of the page when scrolling which we dont want, I tried many tutorials but did not come up with a solution.
Hopefully this will work in the future! So long I have done a lot of work with the css, so next week I am looking forward to doing more with functionality!

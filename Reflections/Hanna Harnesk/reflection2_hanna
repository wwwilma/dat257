Unfortunately I managed to catch a bad case of tonsillitis which
furthermore evolved into a throat abscess last week. This resulted in very high fever and I was unable to produce any
work at all during this time. I have now gotten some medical attention, and medication, and feel a lot better.
I now hope to catch up during this sprint.

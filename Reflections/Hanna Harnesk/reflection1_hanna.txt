During this week I have been trying to do as much work as I can while also taking care of my son who has been home sick,
resulting in a somewhat limited productiveness. However, the main focus has been on learning about javascript and react
which I have not worked with before.
For the upcoming week I hope to be able to increase my physical attendance at the meetings and therefore contribute more
to the team discussions, and also to chip in more on the technical part as we continue to build our application.

This week I am pleased to announce that neither me nor my child have been sick!
I've been working with the finding information about each of the 10 habits for the standard
view that Wilma decided on, and furthermore making this information available in the application.
I've had some problems with my own computer which needed to be reset, but otherwise the work have been going well.

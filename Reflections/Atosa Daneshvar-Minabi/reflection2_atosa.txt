This week I was Product Owner and I think it went well, my opinions on the priorities of the items in the backlog aligned with 
my other team members opinions so that felt good. On my own I feel like I learnt more about javascript and react as I wanted to last week. 
I contributed to the project by creating new pages and the routing for them which was fun. The project has progressed quite a bit compared to 
what we had last week so I'm really looking forward to see what happens to the project next week. Everyone is getting more comfortable with react 
and it'll be exciting to see which ideas the group can think of now that we all know more about how much we can contribute during a week.

I have been at home this whole week because I was sick. The work has gone well anyway though.
I participated in all the meetings online and we did some pair programming too. I worked
with two other members on a big task which let the user favorite a card to their own page.
I added the front end part but then we ran into some problems when we tried to connect the 
functionality to the database. A group member helped solve it in the end though so it all worked out.
Next week is the last sprint which is good because we've already added all the big user stories 
that we wanted to for the project. I hope I get to do some more pair programming then because it 
was very rewarding this week. It'll be exciting to see the finished product then and I'm
looking forward to it!

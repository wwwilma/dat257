My job for the sprint was to work with Hanna on creating a profile logo whihc gave the user the option to "log out" which would lead them to the, 
previously called, "All users" page. This was a fun task which really gave me the opportunity to test my skills on javascript. Even though Hanna had
to work through discord the teamwork went well. I am really proud of how effective we were and that the results looked good. The last to days i were
which resulted in me not working on anything else.

Individual Reflection 3

This week we have done a lot of progress in our project. The site looks very different from last week.
My focus have been on the standard view of the program. 
This means I've done some research to be able to choose 10 habits that will be the standard view.
These 10 habits will be default, our goal is to enable a function that lets the user choose what habits should be tracked.
In addition to the selection of 10 standard habits, I have also decided upon what icons to choose for the cards.
I took some time to decide upon how to implement the icons on the cards, locally or globally.
Now, the standard view has 10 cards with habits and their icons.
Next week, my goal will be to work even more divided between different days.
Even though I've tried to work in small amounts but often, I still feel that I work in too big chunks.

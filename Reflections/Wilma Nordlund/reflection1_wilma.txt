Individual Reflection 1 

The last couple of weeks the group has been deciding on what project to work with.
We have decided on a habit tracking app. We created a Trello workspace, a workspace in Figma, and a Git repository.
We have written user stories and this week we completed sprint 1 where the goal was to create the website and to give it some functionality.
The group have collaborated, we have had discussions and everyone have been a part of the decision-making.
We managed to complete all tasks for sprint 1, and we did also decide on how to give story points, as well as what our definition of done means.
It has been a good start, and we have been working agile in the sense that we have made small improvements.
Although, we may have decided on too few user stories for the first sprint: everyone didn't have that much to do.
I have been reading on React and been searching for information that will be useful during the project work.
I have also been writing parts of our team reflection from this sprint.
It will be exciting to see what we learn next week when we'll have more user stories to complete.
